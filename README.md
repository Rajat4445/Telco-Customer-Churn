# <center> Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## Introduction

This report presents an analysis of customer churn data for a telecommunications company. The Telco customer churn data pertains to a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It details which customers have left, stayed, or newly signed up for their services.

### Objective

The objective of this analysis is to identify the factors contributing to customer churn. The analysis utilizes Tableau for creating visualizations and dashboards to highlight key insights and patterns in the data. Understanding these factors is crucial for devising strategies to enhance customer retention.

## Methodology

### Situation

Customer churn poses a critical challenge for telecommunications companies due to the high cost associated with acquiring new customers compared to retaining existing ones.

### Task

This project aims to analyze the Telco customer churn data to uncover the primary drivers of churn. The findings are presented through interactive dashboards designed in Tableau, enabling stakeholders to visualize and comprehend the insights effectively.

### Methodology Steps

1. **Data Cleaning and Merging:**
   - Handled missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and ensured data quality.
   - Merged data tables using Python to consolidate various customer attributes such as demographic information, service usage patterns, and account details.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualized data distributions, relationships, and patterns using Tableau.

3. **Dashboarding:**
   - Created interactive dashboards and stories to present insights to stakeholders.
   - Devised strategies based on findings to mitigate customer churn issues.

## Results
The analysis culminated in visualizations and dashboards crafted in Tableau, providing actionable insights into customer churn. Further recommendations to address and reduce customer churn are detailed in the report (named `Telco Customer Churn Final Report.pdf`) in this repository.
